# competitive-analyst.md — Portfolio Competitive Analysis

## Target Audience
- Tech leaders and hiring managers at frontier AI labs (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind, xAI, Meta FAIR)
- VP/Director of Engineering at ML-heavy startups
- Recruiters specializing in ML/AI research engineers

## What Frontier Lab Leaders Look For
1. **Depth over breadth** — Deep understanding of a few areas vs. surface-level knowledge of many
2. **Systems thinking** — Can you reason about the full stack from hardware to algorithms?
3. **Research taste** — Can you identify what problems matter?
4. **Shipping record** — Have you built real systems, not just experiments?
5. **Communication** — Can you explain complex ideas clearly?

## Competitor Portfolios (Benchmarks)

### Top-tier ML researcher portfolios typically feature:
- Clean, fast, minimal design
- Clear project descriptions with architecture diagrams
- Blog posts demonstrating technical depth
- Links to papers, repos, and demos
- Strong narrative connecting work to a cohesive research agenda

### Common weaknesses to exploit:
- Most portfolios are static HTML or academic-style pages — poor UX
- Few have interactive visualizations
- Most lack a clear narrative / positioning statement
- Blog posts are often infrequent or too academic
- No video content

## xyang.me Positioning

### Strengths
- **Full-stack depth**: JAX + CUDA + distributed training + production deployment
- **Interactive visual effects**: MatrixBackground + TechGlobe (unique differentiator)
- **Modern tech stack**: React 19 + Tailwind v4 (demonstrates frontend capability too)
- **Content pipeline**: Supports Markdown, LaTeX, Jupyter notebooks
- **Automated deployment**: GitHub Actions → GitHub Pages

### Areas to Develop
- [ ] More blog posts demonstrating technical depth
- [ ] Project pages with architecture diagrams
- [ ] Video walkthroughs of key projects
- [ ] Jupyter notebook renders showing actual research
- [ ] Testimonials or references (if appropriate)
- [ ] Conference talks or presentation recordings

### Unique Value Props
1. "Not just a researcher — a systems engineer who ships"
2. "From CUDA kernels to React components — full stack"
3. "Exploration vs. exploitation mindset — knows when to research and when to ship"
4. "Hardware-aware AI — doesn't treat GPUs as magic boxes"

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | xyang.me | Typical ML Portfolio | Academic Page |
|---------|----------|---------------------|---------------|
| Interactive visuals | TechGlobe, Matrix BG | None | None |
| SPA routing | Yes | Rare | No |
| Dark mode design | Yes (default) | Sometimes | Rare |
| Blog with LaTeX | Yes | Sometimes | Yes (ugly) |

## Improvement Suggestions
1. Add a "Research Agenda" section articulating long-term technical vision
2. Create a "Reading List" page showing intellectual curiosity and taste
3. Add structured data (JSON-LD) for better search visibility
4. Consider a /talks page if any public talks exist
5. Add project demos or interactive notebooks where possible
