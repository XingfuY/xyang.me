# About

I'm **Xingfu Yang**, a PhD-trained engineer who swapped particle simulations for 4D parallelism, bringing scientific rigor to the wild world of machine learning. Whether I'm slashing inference latency or building generative data engines, I love crafting systems that are as smart as they are scalable. My career sits at the intersection of frontier AI research and practical, scalable engineering. Let’s build the future—one optimized pipeline at a time. 

At **Lucid Intel**, I lead a team developing core data products — lead acquisition, non-credit underwriting, and high-frequency fraud prevention — leveraging unsupervised and supervised deep learning on 40M+ identities and billions of records. I also co-created a new business division: an advanced aggregated data analytics platform offering managed agency-of-record services.

## Philosophy

I believe the most impactful AI work happens when you understand the hardware as deeply as the algorithms. Whether it's composing parallelism strategies for training on supercomputers or optimizing CUDA kernels for inference, I operate across every layer of the stack.

My mindset is *exploration vs. exploitation* — knowing when to invest in research and when to ship. Six years of industrial experience have taught me that the best systems emerge from balancing theoretical rigor with pragmatic engineering.
