# About

I'm **Xingfu Yang**, a PhD-trained engineer who swapped particle simulations for 4D parallelism, bringing scientific rigor to the wild world of machine learning. Whether I'm slashing inference latency or building generative data engines, I love crafting systems that are as smart as they are scalable. My career sits at the intersection of frontier AI research and practical, scalable engineering. Let’s build the future—one optimized pipeline at a time. 

My industry career spans two FinTech/AdTech startups where I owned the full ML lifecycle end-to-end. As **Chief Data Scientist at Lucid Intel**, I lead a team building core data products — lead acquisition, non-credit underwriting, and high-frequency fraud prevention — applying unsupervised and supervised deep learning across 40M+ identities and billions of records. I also co-created a new business division: an aggregated data analytics platform offering managed agency-of-record services. Earlier, as **Data Scientist at Leap Theory**, I developed, deployed, and maintained production ML/DL APIs for marketing, remarketing, and risk management — delivering a 55% reduction in unnecessary traffic and a 70% lift in accept ratios for lending clients.

## Philosophy

I believe the most impactful AI work happens when you understand the hardware as deeply as the algorithms. Whether it's composing parallelism strategies for training on supercomputers or optimizing CUDA kernels for inference, I operate across every layer of the stack.

My mindset is *exploration vs. exploitation* — knowing when to invest in research and when to ship. Six years of industrial experience have taught me that the best systems emerge from balancing theoretical rigor with pragmatic engineering.
